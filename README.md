# Food_Organizer_Webapp

Thought 
===================

The hunger Sustainable Development Goal calls for ending hunger in the world by 2030.

India is one of the worst performers on the global hunger index,ranking 94 out of 104 countries in 2020.

The existing methods mostly concentrate on how to manage the food waste rather than preventing the food waste.

We are making an web-app which helps the households to keep tracking of their supermarket purchases and expiry dates which avoids excess buying and wastage and gives a notification a day before the expiry date of a product in the inventory. same as the case with the shopkeeper he can also have customers so that he can directly add them and update their inventory directly.

Over view:-
================================

  Here we tried to develop an web application which would be used by a customer and seller(shop keeper) to keep track of their items. So as to reduce the wastage of food and to save their money.
  Using this web application a normal person can keep track of their inventory so that he can get an overview of what to buy in the next month so as to reduce the wastage indirectly implies in money saving
